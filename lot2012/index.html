<h1>Learnability and Language Acquisition</h1>
<h2>A course at LOT 2012, Tilburg, January 2012</h2>
</center>

<h2>Lecturer</h2>

<p>Alexander Clark, Royal Holloway, University of London.</p>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>
As Chomsky observed, the fundamental problem of linguistics is to satisfy two
conflicting goals: to find formalisms that are sufficiently expressive to represent
the sorts of structures and dependencies that we observe in natural language,
and secondly to account for their acquisition. This course analyses this problem
using the tools of modern computational learning theory, surveying the classical
literature on learnability, and how this motivated a rich notion of UG in the
Principles and Parameters program, and moving on to the current movement in
the Minimalist Program to reduce the work done by the language faculty, perhaps
to a single primitive operation, MERGE.
Along the way we will look at programs and algorithms for learning language, in
both the theoretical sense, and practical implemented algorithms for doing
unsupervised learning from real corpora, including some of child directed speech.
(Much of this is joint work with Shalom Lappin).
