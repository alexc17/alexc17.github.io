  abstract = {This paper presents an application of grammatical inference to the task of shallow parsing. We first learn a deterministic probabilistic automaton that models the joint distribution of Chunk (syntactic phrase) tags and Part-of-speech tags, and then use this automaton as a transducer to find the most likely chunk tag sequence using a dynamic programming algorithm. We discuss an efficient means of incorporating lexical information, which automatically identifies particular words that are useful using a mutual information criterion, together with an application of bagging that improve our results. Though the results are not as high as comparable techniques that use models with a fixed structure, the models we learn are very compact and efficient.},
