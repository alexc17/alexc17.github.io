  abstract = {We study the learnability of Probabilistic Deterministic Finite State Automata under a modified PAC-learning criterion. We argue that it is necessary to add additional parameters to the samplecomplexity polynomial, namely a bound on the expected length of strings generated from any state,and a bound on the distinguishability between states. With this, we demonstrate that the class of PDFAs is PAC-learnable using a variant of a standard state-merging algorithm and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as error function.},
