      <description>A small methodological issue. Suppose you are interested in identifying some single ingredient behind the faculty of language, some property that distinguishes humans from non-humans. This has to be some property that humans have that non-humans don&amp;rsquo;t have. So the argument needs to have two parts: a claim that humans have this property and a claim that humans don&amp;rsquo;t have this property. So this can&amp;rsquo;t be an upper bound on the human ability, but needs to be a lower bound.</description>
