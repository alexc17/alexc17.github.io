 Learning trees from strings: A strong learning algorithm for some
  context-free grammars.

<blockquote>
Standard models of language learning are concerned with weak learning: the learner, receiving as input only information about the strings in the language, must learn to generalise and to generate the correct, potentially infinite, set of strings generated by some target grammar. Here we define the corresponding notion of strong learning: the learner, again only receiving strings as input, must learn a grammar that generates the correct set of structures or parse trees. We formalise this using a modification of Gold's identification in the limit model, requiring convergence to a grammar that is isomorphic to the target grammar. We take as our starting point a simple learning algorithm for substitutable context-free languages, based on principles of distributional learning, and modify it so that it will converge to a canonical grammar for each language. We prove a corresponding strong learning result for a subclass of context-free grammars.

 Statistical representation of grammaticality judgements: The limits

 In <em>Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Cognitive Modelling and

[&nbsp;<a href="clark_bib.html#CGL2013b">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
We use a set of enriched n-gram models to track grammaticality judgements for different sorts
of passive sentences in English. We construct these models by specifying scoring functions
to map the log probabilities (logprobs)  of an n-gram model for a test set of sentences onto
 scores which depend on properties of the string related to the parameters of the model. We test our models on
classification tasks for different kinds of passive sentences. Our experiments indicate that
our n-gram models achieve high accuracy in identifying ill-formed passives in which ill-formedness
depends on local relations within the n-gram frame, but they are far less successful in detecting
non-local relations that produce unacceptability in other types of passive construction. We take
these results to indicate some of the strengths and the limitations of word and lexical class
n-gram models as candidate representations of speakers' grammatical knowledge.

 Towards a statistical model of grammaticality.

<blockquote>
The question of whether it is possible to characterise grammatical knowledge in probabilistic terms
is central to determining the relationship of linguistic representation to other cognitive domains.
We present a statistical model of grammaticality which maps the probabilities of a statistical model for
sentences in parts of the British National Corpus (BNC) into grammaticality scores, using various functions
of the parameters of the model. We test this approach with a classifier on test sets containing different levels
of syntactic infelicity. With appropriate tuning, the classifiers achieve encouraging levels of accuracy. These
experiments suggest that it may be possible to characterise grammaticality judgements in probabilistic terms
using an enriched language model.

 Distributional learning of parallel multiple context-free grammars.

<blockquote>
Natural languages require grammars beyond context-free for their description. Here we extend a family of distributional learning algorithms to the class of Parallel Multiple Context-Free Grammars which include two additional operations beyond the simple context-free operation of concatenation: they include both the ability to interleave or intercalate strings, together with an operation for the copying of strings as well,  which allows the grammars to generate non-semilinear languages, which are outside the class of mildly context-sensitive grammars.
These grammars, if augmented with a suitable feature mechanism, are capable of representing all of the syntactic phenomena that have been claimed to exist in natural language.<p>
We present a learning algorithm for a large subclass of these grammars, that includes all regular languages but not all context-free languages. This algorithm relies on a generalisation of the notion of distribution as a function from tuples of strings to entire sentences; we define nonterminals using finite sets of these functions. Our learning algorithm uses a nonprobabilistic learning paradigm which allows for membership queries as well as positive samples; it runs in polynomial time.

 The syntactic concept lattice another algebraic theory of the

<blockquote>
The syntactic concept lattice is a residuated lattice associated with a given formal language; it arises naturally as a generalization of the syntactic monoid in the analysis of the distributional structure of the language. In this article we define the syntactic concept lattice and present its basic properties, and its relationship to the universal automaton and the syntactic congruence; we consider several different equivalent definitions, as Galois connections, as maximal factorizations and finally using universal algebra to define it as an object that has a certain universal (terminal) property in the category of complete idempotent semirings that recognize a given language, applying techniques from automata theory to the theory of context-free grammars (CFGs). We conclude that grammars that are minimal, in a certain weak sense, will always have non-terminals that correspond to elements of this lattice, and claim that the syntactic concept lattice provides a natural system of categories for representing the denotations of CFGs.

<blockquote>
Learning theory has frequently been applied to language acquisition, but discussion has largely focused on information theoretic problems—in particular on the absence of direct negative evidence. Such arguments typically neglect the probabilistic nature of cognition and learning in general. We argue first that these arguments, and analyses based on them, suffer from a major flaw: they systematically conflate the hypothesis class and the learnable concept class. As a result, they do not allow one to draw significant conclusions about the learner. Second, we claim that the real problem for language learning is the computational complexity of constructing a hypothesis from input data. Studying this problem allows for a more direct approach to the object of study—the language acquisition device—rather than the learnable class of languages, which is epiphenomenal and possibly hard to characterize. The learnability results informed by complexity studies are much more insightful. They strongly suggest that target grammars need to be objective, in the sense that the primitive elements of these grammars are based on objectively definable properties of the language itself. These considerations support the view that language acquisition proceeds primarily through data-driven learning of some form.

 Beyond semilinearity: Distributional learning of parallel multiple

<blockquote>
Semilinearity is widely held to be a linguistic invariant but, controversially, some linguistic phenomena in languages like Old Georgian and Yoruba seem to violate this constraint. In this paper we extend distributional learning to the class of parallel multiple context-free grammars, a class which as far as is known includes all attested natural languages, even taking an extreme view on these examples. These grammars may have a copying operation that can recursively copy constituents, allowing them to generate non-semilinear languages. We generalise the notion of a context to a class of functions that include copying operations. The congruential approach is ineffective at this level of the hierarchy; accordingly we extend this using dual approaches, defining nonterminals using sets of these generalised contexts. As a corollary we also extend the multiple context free grammars using the lattice based approaches.

<blockquote>
Residuated lattices form one of the theoretical backbones of the Lambek Calculus as the standard free models. They also appear in grammatical inference as the syntactic concept lattice, an algebraic structure canonically defined for every language <em>L</em> based on the lattice of all distributionally definable subsets of strings. Recent results show that it is possible to build representations, such as context-free grammars,  based on these lattices, and that these representations will be efficiently learnable using distributional learning. In this paper we discuss the use of these syntactic concept lattices as models of Lambek grammars, and use the tools of algebraic logic to try to link the proof theoretic ideas of the Lambek calculus with the more algebraic approach taken in grammatical inference. 
We can then reconceive grammars of various types  as  equational theories of the syntactic concept lattice of the language.
We then extend this naturally from models based on concatenation of strings, to ones based on concatenations of discontinuous strings, which takes us from context-free formalisms to mildly context sensitive formalisms (multiple context-free grammars) and Morrill's displacement calculus.

<blockquote>
We consider the idea of defining syntactic structure relative to a language, rather than to a grammar for a language. This allows us to define a notion of hierarchical structure that is independent of the particular grammar, and that depends rather on the properties of various algebraic structures canonically associated with a language. 
Our goal is not necessarily to recover the traditional ideas of syntactic structure invented by linguists,
but rather to come up with an objective notion of syntactic structure that can be used for semantic interpretation. The role of syntactic structure is to bring together words and constituents that are apart on the surface, so they can be combined appropriately.
The approach is based on identifying concatenation operations which are non-trivial and using these to constrain the allowable local trees in a structural description.

Using string kernels, languages can be represented as hyperplanes in a high dimensional feature space.

We present a new family of grammatical inference algorithms based on this idea. We demonstrate that some mildly context-sensitive languages can be represented in this way and that it is possible to efficiently learn these using kernel PCA. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on some standard examples of context-sensitive languages using small synthetic data sets.

<blockquote>
We present a polynomial update time algorithm for the inductive inference of a large class of context-free languages using the paradigm of positive data and a membership oracle. We achieve this result by moving to a novel representation, called Contextual Binary Feature Grammars (CBFGs), which are capable of representing richly structured context-free languages as well as some context sensitive languages. These representations explicitly model the lattice structure of the distribution  of a set of substrings and can be inferred using a generalisation of distributional learning. This formalism is an attempt to bridge the gap between simple learnable classes and the sorts of highly expressive representations necessary for linguistic representation: it allows the learnability of a large class of context-free languages, that includes all regular languages and those context-free languages that satisfy two simple constraints. The formalism and the algorithm seem well suited to natural language and in particular to the modeling of first language acquisition. Preliminary experimental results confirm the effectiveness of this approach.

Many algorithms for grammatical inference can be viewed as instances of a more general algorithm which  maintains a set of primitive elements, which  distributionally define sets of strings, and a set of features or tests that constrain various inference rules.
Using this general framework, which we cast as a process of logical inference,
we re-analyse Angluin's famous lstar algorithm 
and several recent algorithms for the inference of context-free grammars and multiple context-free grammars.
Finally, to illustrate the advantages of this approach, we extend it to the

A central problem for NLP is grammar induction: the  development of unsupervised learning algorithms for syntax. In this paper we 
  present a lattice-theoretic representation for natural language syntax, called Distributional Lattice Grammars.
These representations are objective or empiricist, based on a generalisation of distributional learning, and are capable of representing all regular languages, some but not all context-free languages and some non-context-free languages. We present  a simple algorithm for learning these  grammars together with 
a complete self-contained proof of the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.

<blockquote>
The Syntactic Concept Lattice is a residuated lattice based on the distributional structure of a language; the natural representation based on this is a  context sensitive formalism.
Here we examine the possibility of basing a context free grammar (cfg) on the structure of this lattice; in particular by choosing non-terminals to correspond to concepts in this lattice.
We present a learning algorithm for context free grammars  which uses positive data and membership queries, and prove its correctness under the identification in the limit paradigm. 
Since the lattice itself may be infinite, we consider only a polynomially bounded subset of the set of concepts, in order to get an efficient algorithm.
We compare this on the one hand to learning algorithms for  context free grammars,
where the non-terminals correspond to congruence classes,
and on the other hand to the use of context sensitive techniques such as Binary Feature Grammars and Distributional Lattice Grammars.
The class of cfgs that can be learned in this way includes inherently ambiguous and thus non-deterministic languages; this approach therefore breaks through  an important barrier in cfg inference.
ERRATA: there are two significant errors in this paper. I am grateful to Hans Leiss for pointing these out to me, and proposing modifications to the algorithm that correct the errors.

 Three learnable models for the description of language.

<blockquote>
Learnability is a vital property of formal grammars: 
representation classes should be defined in such a way that they are learnable. One way to build learnable representations is by making them objective or empiricist: the structure of the representation should be based on the structure of the language.  Rather than defining a function from representation to language we should start by defining a function from the language to the representation:
following this strategy gives classes of representations that are  easy to learn. 
We illustrate this approach with three classes, defined in analogy to the lowest three levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.
First, we recall the canonical deterministic finite automaton, where the states of the automaton correspond to the right congruence classes of the language.
Secondly, we define context free grammars where the non-terminals of the grammar correspond to the syntactic congruence classes, and where the
productions are defined by the syntactic monoid;
finally we define a residuated  lattice structure from the Galois connection between strings and contexts, which we call the syntactic concept lattice, 
and base a representation on this, which 
allows us to define a class of languages that includes some non-context free languages, many context-free languages and all regular languages.
All three classes are efficiently learnable under suitable learning paradigms.

Indirect negative evidence is clearly an important way for learners to
constrain overgeneralisation, and yet a good learning theoretic

theoretical analysis of indirect negative evidence that allows the
presence of ungrammatical strings in the input
and also accounts for the relationship between
grammaticality/acceptability and probability.
Given independently justified assumptions about lower bounds on the
probabilities of grammatical strings, we establish that a limited
number of membership queries of some strings can be probabilistically
simulated.

 A learnable representation for syntax using residuated lattices.

<blockquote>
We propose a representation for natural language syntax based on 
the theory of residuated lattices: in particular on the Galois lattice between contexts and substrings, which we call the syntactic concept lattice.
The natural representation derived from this is a richly structured
context sensitive formalism that can be learned using a generalisation of distributional learning. In this paper we define the basic algebraic properties of the syntactic concept lattice, 
together with a representation derived from this lattice and 
discuss the generative power of the formalism. We establish some basic results which show that these representations, because they are defined language theoretically, can be inferred from information about the set of grammatical strings of the language.
We also discuss the relation to other grammatical formalisms notably categorial grammar and context free grammars.
We claim that this lattice based formalism is plausibly both learnable from evidence about the grammatical 
strings of a language and may be powerful enough to represent natural languages, and thus presents a potential solution to the central problem of theoretical linguistics.

<blockquote>
We present a polynomial algorithm for the inductive  inference of a
large class of context free languages, that includes all regular
languages. 
The algorithm uses a representation which we call
Binary Feature Grammars based on a set of features, capable of
representing richly 
structured context free languages as well as some context sensitive
languages. 
More precisely, we focus on a particular case of this representation
where the features correspond to contexts appearing in the language.
Using the paradigm of positive data  and a membership oracle, we can
establish that all context free languages that satisfy two
constraints on the context distributions can be identified in the
limit by this approach. The polynomial time algorithm we propose is  based on a
generalisation of distributional learning and uses the lattice of context
occurrences. 
The formalism and the algorithm seem well suited to natural language

 Some alternatives to Parikh matrices using string kernels.
 <em>Fundamenta Informaticae</em>, 84(3-4):291-303, 2008.
[&nbsp;<a href="clark_bib.html#clark08parikh">bib</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote>
We describe methods of representing strings as real valued vectors or matrices; we show how to integrate two separate lines of enquiry: string kernels, developed in machine learning, and Parikh matrices, which have been studied intensively over the last few years as a powerful tool in the study of combinatorics over words. In the field of machine learning, there is widespread use of string kernels, which use analogous mappings into high dimensional feature spaces based on the occurrences of subwords or factors. In this paper we show how one can use string kernels to construct two alternatives to Parikh matrices, that overcome some of the limitations of the Parikh matrix construction. These are morphisms from the free monoid to rings of real-valued matrices under multiplication: one is based on the subsequence kernel and the other on the gap-weighted string kernel. For the latter kernel we demonstrate that for many values of the gap-weight hyper-parameter the resulting morphism is injective.

 Polynomial identification in the limit of substitutable context-free

<blockquote>
This paper formalises the idea of substitutability introduced by
Zellig Harris in the 1950s and makes it the basis for a learning
algorithm from positive data only for a subclass of context-free
languages. We show that there is a polynomial characteristic set, and
thus prove polynomial identification in the limit of this class. We
discuss the relationship of this class of languages to other common
classes discussed in grammatical inference. It transpires that it is
not necessary to identify constituents in order to learn a
context-free language - it is sufficient to identify the syntactic
congruence, and the operations of the syntactic monoid can be
converted into a context-free grammar. We also discuss modifications
to the algorithm that produces a reduction system rather than a
context-free grammar, that will be much more compact. We discuss the
relationship to Angluin's notion of reversibility for regular
languages. We also demonstrate that an implementation of this
algorithm is capable of learning a classic example of structure
dependent syntax in English: this constitutes a refutation of an
argument that has been used in support of nativist theories of
language.

Though the OSTIA algorithm has good asymptotic guarantees for this class of problems, the amount of data required is prohibitive. We therefore developed a new strategy for inferring large scale transducers that is more adapted for large random instances of the type in question, which involved
combining traditional state merging algorithms for inference of finite state automata with EM based alignment algorithms and state splitting algorithms.

Strings can be mapped into Hilbert spaces using feature maps such as
the Parikh map. Languages can then be defined as the pre-image of
hyperplanes in the feature space, rather than using grammars or
automata. These are the <em>planar</em> languages. 
In this paper we show that using techniques from 
kernel-based learning, we can represent and efficiently learn, from
positive data alone, various linguistically interesting context-sensitive
languages. In particular we show that the cross-serial dependencies in
Swiss German, that established the non-context-freeness of natural
language, are learnable using a standard kernel.
We demonstrate the polynomial-time identifiability in
the limit of these classes, and discuss some language theoretic
properties of these classes, and their relationship to the choice of

We show that evaluation on synthetic data is potentially misleading and fails to give an accurate evaluation of the performance on real data. Moreover, we provide a critical review of existing evaluation metrics in the literature and we propose an improved evaluation metric.

<blockquote>
One  argument for parametric models of language has been learnability in the context of first language acquisition. 
The claim is made that &ldquo;logical&rdquo; arguments from learnability theory require  non-trivial constraints on the class of languages.
Initial formalisations of the problem (Gold, 1967) are however inapplicable to this particular situation.
In this paper we construct an appropriate formalisation of the problem using a modern vocabulary drawn from statistical learning theory and grammatical inference
 and looking in detail at the relevant empirical facts. 
We claim that a 
variant of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning  framework (Valiant, 984) with positive samples only, modified so it is not completely distribution free is the appropriate choice. 
Some negative results derived from cryptographic problems appear to apply in this situation
but the existence of algorithms with provably good performance and subsequent work, 
shows how these negative results are not as strong as they initially appear, and that recent algorithms for learning
regular languages partially satisfy our criteria.
We then discuss the applicability of these results to parametric and non-parametric models.

 PAC-learnability of probabilistic deterministic finite state
  automata.

<blockquote>
We study the learnability of Probabilistic Deterministic Finite State Automata under a modified PAC-learning criterion. We argue that it is necessary to add additional parameters to the sample complexity polynomial, namely a bound on the expected length of strings generated from any state, and a bound on the distinguishability between states. With this, we demonstrate that the class of PDFAs is PAC-learnable using a variant of a standard state-merging algorithm and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as error function.

 Partially distribution-free learning of regular languages from
  positive samples.

<blockquote>
Regular languages are widely used in NLP today in spite of their shortcomings.
Efficient algorithms that can reliably learn these languages, and which must in
realistic applications only
use positive samples, are necessary.
These languages are not learnable under traditional distribution free
criteria.
We claim that an appropriate learning framework is PAC learning where the distributions are constrained
to be generated by a class of stochastic automata with support equal to the target concept.
We discuss how this is related to other learning paradigms.
We then present a simple learning algorithm for regular languages,
and a self-contained proof that it learns according to this partially
distribution free criterion.

 Pre-processing very noisy text.

<blockquote>
Existing techniques for tokenisation and sentence boundary identification are extremely accurate whenthe data is perfectly clean (Mikheev, 2002), and have been applied successfully to corpora of news feeds and other post-edited corpora. Informal written texts are readily available, and with the growth ofother informal text modalities (IRC, ICQ, SMS etc.) are becoming an interesting alternative, perhaps better suited as a source for lexical resources and language models for studies of dialogue andspontaneous speech. However, the high degree of spelling errors, irregularities and idiosyncrasies in the use of punctuation, white space and capitalisation require specialised tools. In this paper we study thedesign and implementation of a tool for pre-processing and normalisation of noisy corpora. We argue that rather than having separate tools for tokenisation, segmentation and spelling correction organisedin a pipeline, a unified tool is appropriate because of certain specific sorts of errors. We describe how a noisy channel model can be used at the character level to perform this. We describe how the sequenceof tokens needs to be divided into various types depending on their characteristics, and also how the modelling of white-space needs to be conditioned on the type of the preceding and following tokens.We use trainable stochastic transducers to model typographical errors, and other orthographic changes and a variety of sequence models for white space and the different sorts of tokens. We discuss thetraining of the models and various efficiency issues related to the decoding algorithm, and illustrate this with examples from a 100 million word corpus of Usenet news.

 Natural language queries on natural language data: a database of

<blockquote>
This paper describes an integrated system that enables the storage and retrieval of meeting transcripts (e.g. staff meetings). The system gives users who have not attended a meeting, or who want to review a particular point, enhanced access to an annotated version of the recorded data. This paper describes the various stages in the processing, storage and query of the data. First, we put forward the idea of shallow dialogue processing, in order to extract significant features of the meeting transcriptions for storage in a database, whose structure is briefly outlined. Low-level access to the database is provided as a Web service, which can be connected to several interfaces. A description of how multimodal input can be used with VoiceXML is also provided, thus offering an easy solution for voice and web based access to the dialogue data. The paper ends with considerations about the available data and its use in the current version of the system.

 Memory-based learning of morphology with stochastic transducers.

<blockquote>
This paper discusses the supervised learning of morphology using stochastic transducers, 
trained using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
Two approaches are presented: first, using the transducers directly to model the process, and secondly using them to 
define a similarity measure, related to the Fisher kernel method,  
and then using a Memory-Based Learning (MBL) technique.
These are evaluated and compared on data sets from  English, German, Slovene  and Arabic.

 In this paper I present a novel Machine Learning approach to the acquisition of stochastic string transductions based on
 Pair Hidden Markov Models (PHMMs), a model used in computational biology.
 I show how these models can be used to learn morphological processes in a variety of languages, including English, German and Arabic.  
	Previous techniques for learning morphology have been restricted to languages with essentially concatenative morphology.
