<h3>Current position</h3>

<p> I am a lecturer in the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/philosophy/index.aspx">Department of Philosophy</a> at <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk">King's College London</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am also an honorary Research Fellow in the <a href="http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/">Department of
Computer Science</a> in <a
href="http://www.rhul.ac.uk/">Royal Holloway University of London</a>.
</p>

<h3>Research interests</h3>

<p>A very brief research narrative: the majority of the papers I have written are to
do with unsupervised learning of natural language, and its relevance
to first language acquisition. I have approached this both theoretically
and practically: trying to define what a good definition of learnability is, trying
to prove that you can learn languages according to various models
of learnability, designing algorithms, and writing computer programs that
can learn models of language both from synthetic and natural examples.</p>

<p>In the last few years I have been looking at formal results.
If a learning algorithm works at all, then it should be possible to identify
a class of languages, and some conditions such that you can prove that the learner will acquire that class under those conditions.</p>

<p>I have published some papers on
learning regular languages and finite automata, which are summarised 
<a href="regular.html">on this page</a>.</p>

<p>In the last few years I have been working almost exclusively on context free and context sensitive grammatical inference using techniques from distributional learning ; this work is summarised 
<a href="cfg.html">on this page</a>.</p>

<p>I won the
<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/Omphalos/">Omphalos competition</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~tenjinno/">Tenjinno competition</a>,
which were two grammatical inference
competitions in learning context free grammars and transductions, respectively.</p>

<p>Recently I have been working on learning context free and context
sensitive languages, using some ideas from structuralist linguistics.
A paper on this won the best paper award at CoNLL 2010.
The paper is available <a href="papers/CONLL2010proceedings.pdf"> here</a>.
The paper gives an algebraic treatment -- the slides have lots of diagrams that may help -- they are <a href="slides/conll2010presentation.pdf"> here</a>.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Before arriving here I was a post-doc at <a
href="http://www.issco.unige.ch/">ISSCO</a>, at the <a
href="http://www.unige.ch/">University of Geneva</a> working on the <a
href="http://www.im2.ch/">IM2 Project</a>, a large Swiss project on Multimodal Information Management.</p>

<p>My first degree was in Mathematics from Trinity College, Cambridge. My Ph.D. is from the University of Sussex.</p>


<h3>Current Activities</h3>


<p>I am working on a project called Statistical Models of Grammaticality (<a href="http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/lappin/smog/">SMOG</a>) which is based at King's College, London. </p>

<h3>Unpublished notes, drafts, squibs, etc.</h3>

<ul>
<li> A non technical note on MCFGs for linguists that I wrote for a
  course a few years ago.  <a
href="lot2012/mcfgsforlinguists.pdf">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Errata</h3>

Some of my published work contains errors; I list the ones that I know
  about here. If you find some more, please let me know.

  <ul>
    <li>JMLR 2004 paper on learning PDFAs. There is an error in Lemma 13; I am
    grateful to Satyaki Mahalanabis for pointing this out. There are a
    number of ways of fixing this, so the main result still stands,
    albeit with a different bound,
    though the proof as it is presented is not complete. A correction
    is available <a href="errata/jmlr_correction2.pdf">here</a>. </li>

    <li>
Hans Leiss pointed out that there is an error in my paper <i>Learning
    CFGs with the finite context property</i>.
    His correction is published now in Proceedings of FG 2014.
    </li>

    <li>There is a problem with the proof of Proposition 5 and Lemma 2 in my paper on
    PAC-learning unambigous NTS languages from 2006. The samples may
    not be negatively associated in the appropriate way. I don't know
    what the best way of fixing this problem is. I am grateful to Ryo
    Yoshinaka for pointing out this problem.
    </li>
    </ul>
