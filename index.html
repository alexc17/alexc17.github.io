<h3>Current</h3>

<p> I am currently (Autumn 2018) visiting at the Turing Institute in London.</p>

<p> I am a Visiting Senior Research Fellow in the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/philosophy/index.aspx">Department of Philosophy</a> at <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk">King's College London</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am also an honorary Research Fellow in the <a href="http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/">Department of
Computer Science</a> in <a
href="http://www.rhul.ac.uk/">Royal Holloway University of London</a>.
</p>

<h3>Research interests</h3>

<p>A very brief research narrative: the majority of the papers I have written are to
do with unsupervised learning of natural language, and its relevance
to first language acquisition. I have approached this both theoretically
and practically: trying to define what a good definition of learnability is, trying
to prove that you can learn languages according to various models
of learnability, designing algorithms, and writing computer programs that
can learn models of language both from synthetic and natural examples.</p>

<p>I won the
<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/Omphalos/">Omphalos competition</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~tenjinno/">Tenjinno competition</a>,
which were two grammatical inference
competitions in learning context free grammars and transductions, respectively.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Before arriving here I was a post-doc at <a
href="http://www.issco.unige.ch/">ISSCO</a>, at the <a
href="http://www.unige.ch/">University of Geneva</a> working on the <a
href="http://www.im2.ch/">IM2 Project</a>, a large Swiss project on Multimodal Information Management.</p>

<p>My first degree was in Mathematics from Trinity College, Cambridge. My Ph.D. is from the University of Sussex.</p>


<h3>Past Projects</h3>

context-free grammars described in  <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v14/clark13a.html">this JMLR

<h3>Publications</h3>




<p>
Look on my <a href="clark.html">publications page</a> for copies of any of these, or
for abstracts on <a href="clark_abstracts.html">this page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Unpublished notes, drafts, squibs, etc.</h3>

<ul>
<li> A non technical note on MCFGs for linguists that I wrote for a
  course a few years ago.  <a
href="papers//mcfgsforlinguists.pdf">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Errata</h3>

Some of my published work contains errors; I list the ones that I know
  about here. If you find some more, please let me know.

  <ul>
    <li>JMLR 2004 paper on learning PDFAs. There is an error in Lemma 13; I am
    grateful to Satyaki Mahalanabis for pointing this out. There are a
    number of ways of fixing this, so the main result still stands,
    albeit with a different bound,
    though the proof as it is presented is not complete. A correction
    is available <a href="errata/jmlr_correction2.pdf">here</a>. </li>

    <li>
Hans Leiss pointed out that there is an error in my paper <i>Learning
    CFGs with the finite context property</i>.
    His correction is published now in Proceedings of FG 2014.
    </li>

    <li>There is a problem with the proof of Proposition 5 and Lemma 2 in my paper on
    PAC-learning unambigous NTS languages from 2006. The samples may
    not be negatively associated in the appropriate way. I don't know
    what the best way of fixing this problem is. I am grateful to Ryo
    Yoshinaka for pointing out this problem.
    </li>
    </ul>
